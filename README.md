# stew

`stew` is a terminal user interface (TUI) for the Salesforce CLI (`sf`), built with Go and the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework. It aims to provide a more interactive and visual way to manage Salesforce environments and metadata directly from the command line.

Stew was built with the goal of being an easy-to-integrate UI for interacting with the SF CLI in code editors other than VS Code, such as **Zed**, by leveraging its tasks feature.

You can checkout [SF Zed Tasks](https://github.com/brtheo/sf-zed-tasks) a comprehensive collection of `sf` and `stew` **Zed tasks**.
.

```bash
npm install -g @brtheo/stew
